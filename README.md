# UBC Physics Society - LaTeX Notes
## Download LaTeX
The first thing you'll need to do today is install LaTeX on your own computer. There are several different ways to get LaTeX, depending on what operating system you use.

### Linux
The simplest way to install LaTeX under Linux is to use your distribution's package manager.

Ubuntu and Debian users can enter the following in a terminal:
```$ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended```

### Windows
The easiest way to get LaTeX on Windows is to download and install MikTeX.  MikTeX gives you a full LaTeX distribution along with a nice editor and all the required programs to use LaTeX. It also comes with its own package manager, which makes it easy to download and install new LaTeX addons.

You can download MikTeX [here](http://miktex.org/download). Scroll down to the *"Basic MiKTeX 2.9" Installer* and click on the *Download* button.

### Mac OS X
The preferred way to obtain LaTeX for OS X appears to be to install MacTeX, which can be obtained [here](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html).

## Download and Install RevTeX
You can download RevTeX from [the APS website](https://authors.aps.org/revtex4/index.html).

### Linux
If you're running Linux, you should download and install the file from there.  Just download it, unzip it, and follow the instructions in the README.

### Windows
On Windows, you can install RevTeX from MikTeX's package manager.  The package you want to look for is simply called "revtex". It should take care of everything.

### OS X
Under OS X, you should be able to simply follow the same procedure as for Linux.

## Edit the Template
Now, you'll need to open up the template and edit it.  The best way to do this is to use a text editor.  This is a program whose specialty is editing plain text files.

### Linux
Under Linux, [Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit) is a simple and relatively easy to use choice. If you're feeling adventurous, the text editor [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/) along with the [AUCTeX](http://www.gnu.org/s/auctex/) environment is probably the most powerful and efficient way to edit LaTeX. 

Along with Emacs, the other "standard" text editor is [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), for which [Vim-LaTeX](http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/) is available. Any of these editors can be installed through your package manager.

### Windows
For Windows, you can use TexWorks, which comes with MikTeX. Another popular choice is [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), which is a fully-featured text editor with lots of nice features.

### OS X
If you're on OS X, MacTex comes with a few options, including TeXShop and TeXWorks. There is also an OS X port of Vim called [macvim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/).

## Useful Documentation
This LaTeX session can only teach you the basics. To really get down to using LaTeX, you'll need some good documentation to refer to. Fortunately, since LaTeX is so widely used, there are lots of good references to be found.

* A good starting point is the [official LaTeX Project web site](http://www.latex-project.org/) which has links to many guides and also has a good list of books about LaTeX.
* The [Wikibooks
          LaTeX](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/) guide is another excellent and quite comprehensive resource which is loaded with information.
